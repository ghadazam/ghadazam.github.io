            <h2>About The Workshop</h2>
		  <p>Deep learning continues to make a significant impact in biomedical research, engineering, and healthcare. It has been shown to have a significant impact in image acquisition, image analysis and understanding, and natural language processing applied to e-health. In medical image processing, deep learning, or artificial intelligence (AI), has spawned several research topics related to healthcare applications, which rely heavily on extracting useful information from complex images of various modalities. These applications demand high performance from key image analysis subtasks, e.g., segmentation, classification, visual information retrieval, and disease screening and diagnostics, among others. In spite of these advances, open challenges remain regarding efficiency in deep learning network design, impact of data characteristics, interpretation transparency and explainability, and effectiveness in decision reliability of predictions. The proposed workshop aims to address these issues through invited presentations from research leaders involved in machine learning and artificial intelligence research. </p>

                Intelligent monitoring systems and affective computing applications have emerged in the recent years to enhance patient outcomes, and hence healthcare. Examples of these applications include intelligent monitoring of physiological changes and sedation states as well as assessment of affective states such as pain and depression. The intelligent monitoring of patients’ conditions and affective states can: 1) lead to better understanding of their pattern; 2) provide consistent and continuous assessment, and hence prompt intervention; 3) expedite the early hospital discharge; 4) decrease the family stress and financial burden; and 5) make healthcare more accessible to patients at homes and in rural areas.
                <br /> <br />
                Though the intelligent monitoring of affective states has been around for the past several years, integrating contextual, personalized, uncertainty, and multimodal information recorded from vulnerable populations has been less explored. Integrating contextual and personalized information has a great potential to enhance healthcare as it allows to tailor treatment based on the characteristics of a specific patient or group. The integration of uncertainty to healthcare applications is critical as it plays a significant role in medical decision making. Finally, the fusion of multiple sources of data (e.g., vocal, visual, physiological, text) has been proven to reduce the misclassification error and increase the reliability of intelligent systems. In addition to the lack of integration of these information to affective healthcare applications, there has been insufficient focus on vulnerable populations such as infants, children, and elderly. Computational and affective intelligence can be used in multiple ways to improve healthcare of vulnerable populations. For example, the intelligent assessment and prediction of neonatal pain or sedation states can enable prompt intervention and lead to reduced pain/sedative-related outcomes. Further, the continuous monitoring of elderly’s health conditions allows to identify changes in their conditions, enables the review of trends in specific parameters over time, and enhance aging in place. Hence, we believe there is a need for a workshop that addresses and discusses these issues.
                <br /><br />
                We propose the first workshop that focuses on using intelligent and affective computing methods to enhance healthcare of vulnerable populations. In particular, the workshop focuses on using state-of-the-art techniques for multimodal, context-aware, interpretable, personalized, and uncertainty modeling of affective states and health conditions in vulnerable populations. It will bring together researchers who are working on developing intelligent and affective computing systems that involve non-ideal conditions, like those that might be present in a real-world environment. It will expose current applications and datasets to enhance healthcare of vulnerable populations. It will also provide an interdisciplinary forum for the exchange of ideas on novel applications, new datasets, current challenges, and future directions.
